        <p>So far, layout has been a linear process that handles open tags and
            close tags independently. But web pages are trees, and look like them:
            borders and backgrounds visually nest inside one another. To support
            that, this chapter switches to <em>tree-based layout</em>, where the
            tree of elements is transformed into a tree of <em>layout objects</em>
            for the visual elements of the page. In the process, weâ€™ll make our web
            pages more colorful with backgrounds.</p>
